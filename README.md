# Node express generator

My shot at creating an automated express setup. Please, do tell me how can I
improve it.

## Why not just use express-generator?

It does not supports ES6 import/export, typescript nor scss by default, which I
prefer.

## How to use it?

It is still being developed, so, for now, clone this repo and run `main.sh` from
another location to generate the directory.

Firstly, grant it executable permission:

```console
$ chmod +x /path/to/this/repo/main.sh
```

Then, you can run it

```console
$ ./path/to/this/repo/main.sh
```
